# Deep Learning
## Predicting BTC price based on past 10 days
### LSTM Stock Predictor Using Fear and Greed Index
### Data Preparation:
### 1. Used the window_data function to generate the X and y values for the model.
### 2. Split the data into 70% training and 30% testing
### 3. Applied the MinMaxScaler to the X and y values
### 4. Reshaped the X_train and X_test data for the model.

### Build and Train the LSTM RNN
### 1. Build the LSTM model.
### 2. Fit the model to the training data.
### 3. Evaluated the model using the test data.

### Conclusion
Which model has a lower loss? Closing price data</br>
Which model tracks the actual values better over time? Closing price data </br>
Which window size works best for the model? 10
